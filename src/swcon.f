C  PURPOSE  CONTROLLING ROUTINE FOR SORT
C
C  METHOD   ROUTINE DETERMINES WHICH KIND
C           OF SORT IS REQUIRED AND CALLS
C           APPLICABLE ROUTINE TO CARRY OUT SORT
C           THE 4 TYPES OF SORT THAT ARE AVAILABLE ARE
C
C           INCORE,LINK LIST (HART)
C           INCORE,IN SITU POINTERS
C           OUT-OF-CORE,FIXED TUPLE SIZE
C           OUT-OF-CORE,VARIABLE TUPLE SIZE
C           INCORE SORT IS FIXED OR VARIABLE
C           LTUPLE TUPLES
C
C  TIMING   UNKNOWN
C
C  DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
C
C  INFIL   UNIT CONTAINING INPUT TUPLES
C          EACH TUPLE IS WRITTEN AS A
C          RECORD AS FOLLOWS
C          FOR FIXED LENGTH RECORDS
C            WRITE(INFIL) (TUP(I),I=1,LTUPLE)
C          FOR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS
C            WRITE(INFIL) L,(TUP(I),I=1,L)
C
C  OUTFIL  UNIT TO CONTAIN SORTED TUPLES
C          OUTFIL MAY EQ INFIL
C          FORMAT OF OUTFIL IS THE
C          SAME AS THAT OF INFIL

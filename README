What's it good for?

Experience has convinced me that Rim is best for databases
that will be updated by programs.  It provides a convenient
program interface and much support for loading and unloading
and maintaining databases.  It does not, however, present
a very convenient user interface for adding or changing data.
It has no screens.  It does allow applications to be very 
portable---as long as you keep them clean of system dependencies.
